NAME
     first - an adaptation of last to display  login  and  logout
     information about users and terminals

SYNOPSIS
     first [-a] [-n number | -number] [-f filename] [-u]
          [name | tty]...


DESCRIPTION
     The first command looks in the  /var/adm/wtmpx  file,  which
     records  all  logins  and  logouts,  for information about a
     user, a terminal, or any group of users and terminals. Argu-
     ments  specify  names  of users or terminals of interest. If
     multiple arguments are given, the information applicable  to
     any  of  the  arguments  is printed. For example, first root
     console lists all of root's sessions, as well  as  all  ses-
     sions  on  the console terminal. first displays the sessions
     of the specified users and  terminals,  most  recent  first,
     indicating  the  times at which the session began, the dura-
     tion of the session, and the terminal on which  the  session
     took place. first also indicates whether the session is con-
     tinuing or was cut short by a reboot.


     The pseudo-user reboot logs in when the system  is  shutdown
     and when it reboots. Thus,

       first reboot




     gives an approximate record of  when  the  operating  system
     instance was shutdown and when it rebooted. This can be used
     to calculate the availability of the operating  system  over
     time.


     first with no arguments displays a record of all logins  and
     logouts, in reverse order.


     If first is interrupted, it indicates how far the search has
     progressed  in  /var/adm/wtmpx.  If  interrupted with a quit
     signal (generated by a CTRL-\), first indicates how far  the
     search has progressed, and then continues the search.
